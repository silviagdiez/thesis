function [r,t1,t2,ar,a1,a2] = tier05(res,myclass,alpha,v)
%=== This function computes the first and second 
% tiers of the ranking of a list of songs with the number of classes
% "res" > is the similarity matrix
% "myclass" > is the vector class (row vector)
% "alpha" > (1-alpha) is the confidence for the intervals
% "v" > is the vector of songs which are used as queries 
% First tier: # of correctly retrieved songs within the best (C-1) matches
%            divided by (C-1) where C is the size of the song class.
% Second tier: # of correctly retrieved songs within the best (2C-1)
%                matches divided by (2C-1).
